<h3>The Good The Bad and The Ugly</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the best Spaghetti Western movie ever made! The actors, scenary, the story line, the music score.  A perfect movie to me.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Another classic. I've watched this movie more then 25 times.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This movie is so much fun to watch!  So many good actors/actresses.</p>

<h3>Tombstone</h3>
<p>Val Kilmer killed in this movie.  He should've won an oscar for this role!</p>

<h3>Fargo</h3>
<p>This movie was so fun to watch.  I love the northern accent.</p>

<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>One of the best Mafia movies ever made.</p>

<h3>The Godfather I</h3>
<P>The best Mafia movie ever made from one of the best directors.</P>

<h3>The Godfather II</h3>
<p>Usually part 2 is not as good as the original but this one is.</p>
